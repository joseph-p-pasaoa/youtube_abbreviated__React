        <p>
          YouTube Abbreviated takes the user's inputed search and returns eight
          of the top results from the YouTube API (Thanks, 
            YouTube). 
          The user is then able to watch any of the results in a separate single
          video page which allows comments to be submitted and displayed.
        </p>

        <p style={{color: "#ccc"}}>
          The logo is a combined-on-load duo of pngs obtained from PNGGuru. The
          fonts of Roboto--which YouTube primarily uses currently, and Open Sans 
          are used here. No css libraries were implemented because there was no 
          time to incorporate them within the time alloted.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          YouTube Abbreviated is at it's core a clean React app developed
          under the shadow of the Technical Mastery Assessment Component of the famed
          Pursuit Full-Stack Web Development Fellowship real-life app.
